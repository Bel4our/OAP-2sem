NASA has reached a significant technological milestone with progress on an experimental form of spacecraft propulsion.
This was a major last step on the ground before it's ready to be proposed for space missions," NASA technologist Les Johnson said.
What's next is for scientists to propose the use of solar sails in their missions, we've met our goal and demonstrated that we're ready.
